### Oprah vs. Franzen

{{% resource_link "1a7da90b-bce0-497a-baa7-0f76e7f9cf4e" "Rejecting the Oprah Sticker" %}}: This is a brief piece about the tiff between Oprah and Jonathan Franzen, who is arguably one of those white male modernist writers that John Young talks about in his article. Their dispute developed after Franzen was less than enthusiastic about The Corrections being chosen for Oprah's Book Club. It still won a National Book Award. \[Miller, Laura. "Book Lovers' Quarrel." Salon.com, October 26, 2001.

### Discussion of comics shop visit

The following blogs feature debates that arise as the comic book industry deals with the state of comic book shops. Your task in reading these sites is threefold: follow this controversy and see what it says about fandom and about blogs as a medium; pay attention to gender, which is featured especially in the entry from Jennifer De Guzman (SLG-news); follow the discussion BEYOND these four links, and see where else the debate goes through links and comments. Come to class prepared to comment.

### Suggested

Squaires, Claire. _Marketing Literature: The Making of Contemporary Writing in Britain_. London, UK: Palgrave, 2007, chapter 1. ISBN: 9781403997739.  
This reading covers a lot of ground, charting changes that happened throughout the 1990s in the book trades. Her focus is London, but what she says certain applies just as well to a US context. It will help you think about how certain books become bestsellers (especially certain literary books).
